**Stock Analysis Report**
**Objective:**
The goal of this analysis is to explore and visualize historical stock data for Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), calculate various metrics, and use a neural network to predict the closing price of Microsoft's stock.

**Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:**
Used Yahoo Finance and Pandas DataReader to fetch historical stock data for GOOG and MSFT.
Prepared the data by calculating daily returns, moving averages, and creating a correlation matrix.

**Data Visualization:**
Plotted the adjusted closing prices for GOOG and MSFT to visualize their historical performance.
Visualized moving averages for different time periods (10, 20, 50 days) to identify trends.
Analyzed the daily return and histogram for each stock.

**Correlation Analysis:**
Explored the correlation between GOOG and MSFT stocks using scatter plots and pair plots.
Created a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix.

**Risk and Return Analysis:**
Calculated and visualized the risk vs. return for each stock.
Determined the value at risk (VaR) by investing in each stock.

**Neural Network for Stock Price Prediction (MSFT):**
Fetched historical stock data for Microsoft to predict the closing price.
Preprocessed the data and created a training dataset.
Used a neural network with LSTM layers to build the predictive model.
Trained the model and visualized the predicted vs. actual closing prices.

**Conclusion:**
This analysis provides insights into the historical performance and correlation between Google and Microsoft stocks. The risk and return analysis offers an understanding of the investment dynamics. Additionally, the neural network model shows the potential for predicting stock prices, with visualizations indicating the model's performance.
